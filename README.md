# korad_control
A linux command line python program to control the Korad KA6003P and other Korad bench power supplies.

Connect the PSU to a computer via a serial port or USB and use the program to control the PSU in place of the front panel buttons. It includes an option to monitor the CC-CV charging of batteries and turn off the output when the minimum current is reached (E.G. typically 10ma per cell for 18650 Li-Ion cells).
